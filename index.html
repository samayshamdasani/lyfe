<h3 class="major">HELLO WORLD</h3>
<p class="about">On May 17th, 2001, I had entered this world with no idea of what's to come. I hope this little spot on the internet is going to be a place where I can look back on every important moment of my life - kinda like a mini-journal. I'm currently 15 years old and am typing this on December 20th, 2016. Let's see how long this lasts :)</p>

<h3 class="major">MY TECH OBSESSION</h3>
<p class="about">At this time, I've had time to grow and learn about the world. Perhaps the biggest influence of my life was when one of my friends showed me his iPod and all the games he had downloaded. That moment was the beginning of the months of begging to my parents for one of my own. Eventually, for my eighth birthday, I got an <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/ipod/specs/ipod-touch-2g-specs.html">iPod Touch 2nd generation </a> - and all I remember was that I fell in love.</p>

<h3 class="major">MAKING YOUTUBE VIDEOS</h3>
<p class="about">This was such a big event in my life because my dad had just bought an <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/sp588?locale=en_US">iMac</a> for the family - something that further pursued my interest in technology. Every day after school, I began to sit down and watch guys like <a href="https://youtube.com/mkbhd">MKBHD</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/duncan33303">Austin Evans</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDlQwv99CovKafGvxyaiNDA">Jonathan Morrision</a> on YouTube and constantly learning about the latest software, phones, tablets, laptops, and cameras (and basically anything related to the vast world of technology). That's when I was inspired to start my own channel. My <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBw0vwWZlO8">first video</a> was an unboxing of my mom's iPhone 5 and I remember how I forced my mom to hold the camera while I narrarated the specs of the phone. When I hit 100 subscribers and started getting small products like cases and speakers from companies to review, I felt pretty important. To this day, I enjoy creating videos and showing them to the world (and I hope I still will).</p>
